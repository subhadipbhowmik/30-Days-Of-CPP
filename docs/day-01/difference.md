## Difference Between C and C++

(1) C

1. Dennis Ritchie developed the C programming language between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs.
2. C lacks polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance, meaning it does not support object-oriented programming.
3. C is largely a subset of C++.
4. The number of keywords in C varies by version:
   * C90: 32
   * C99: 37
   * C11: 44
   * C23: 59
5. C supports procedural programming for code development.
6. In C, data and functions are separated due to its procedural programming nature.
7. C does not support information hiding.
8. Built-in data types are supported in C.
9. C is a function-driven language because it is procedural.
10. C does not support function and operator overloading.
11. C is driven by functions.
12. Functions in C are not defined within structures.
13. C does not have namespace features.
14. The standard IO header in C is stdio.h.
15. C does not support reference variables.
16. Virtual and friend functions are not supported in C.
17. C does not support inheritance.
18. C focuses on methods or processes rather than data.
19. C provides malloc() and calloc() for dynamic memory allocation, and free() for memory deallocation.
20. C does not directly support exception handling.
21. The functions scanf() and printf() are used for input and output in C.
22. C structures do not have access modifiers.
23. There is no strict type checking in C.
24. C does not support overloading.
25. Type punning with unions is allowed in C99 and later.
26. Named initializers can appear out of order.
27. The file extension for C files is ".c".
28. C supports meta-programming through macros and _Generic().
29. C90 has 32 keywords.


(2) C++

1. Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ in 1979.
2. C++ includes polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance, making it an object-oriented language.
3. C++ is essentially a superset of C.
4. The number of keywords in C++ varies by version:
   * C++98: 63
   * C++11: 73
   * C++17: 73
   * C++20: 81
5. C++ is considered a hybrid language because it supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.
6. In C++, data and functions are encapsulated within objects.
7. Encapsulation in C++ hides data to ensure proper usage of data structures and operators.
8. C++ supports both built-in and user-defined data types.
9. C++ is object-driven due to its object-oriented programming nature.
10. C++ supports both function and operator overloading.
11. C++ is driven by objects.
12. Functions can be included within structures in C++.
13. C++ uses namespaces to prevent name conflicts.
14. The standard input/output header in C++ is iostream.h.
15. C++ supports reference variables.
16. C++ supports virtual and friend functions.
17. Inheritance is supported in C++.
18. C++ prioritizes data over methods or procedures.
19. C++ uses the new operator for memory allocation and the delete operator for memory deallocation.
20. Exception handling is a feature of C++.
21. The cin and cout functions are used for input and output in C++.
22. C++ structures include access modifiers.
23. C++ enforces strict type checking, causing many programs that compile in C to produce warnings or errors in C++.
24. C++ supports overloading.
25. Type punning with unions is undefined behavior in C++, except in specific cases.
26. Named initializers in C++ must match the struct's data layout.
27. C++ file extensions include ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc", and ".cxx".
28. Meta-programming in C++ is done using templates, though macros are still supported but discouraged.
29. C++ has a total of 97 keywords.

## Getting Started

To start programming in C++, you'll need a development environment with a C++ compiler. Popular compilers include GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++. You can choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion to write and compile your code efficiently.

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Save this code in a file with a `.cpp` extension, compile it using a C++ compiler, and execute the resulting program to see the output.

## What's Next?

- **Learn Basic Syntax**: Dive into the syntax, data types, control structures, and functions in C++.
- **Explore Advanced Concepts**: Study topics like pointers, memory management, templates, and exception handling.
- **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Solve programming challenges and work on projects to reinforce your learning.
- **Refer Official Documentation**: Utilize online resources, books, and official C++ references to deepen your understanding.

C++ is a vast language with numerous possibilities. Enjoy your journey in mastering this versatile programming language!
