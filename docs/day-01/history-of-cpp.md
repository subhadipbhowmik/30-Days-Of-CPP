## History of CPP

The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both low-level & high-level language – a Middle-Level Language. The programming language was created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist – Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched. 

C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and was renamed C++ in 1983. ++ is shorthand for adding one to variety in programming; therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher than C.” 

## What is C++?

C++ is an extension of the C programming language with added features such as object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities. It provides a robust set of tools and allows low-level memory manipulation while also supporting high-level abstractions. Known for its efficiency and performance, C++ is often chosen for applications that require speed and resource management.This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers. This C++ Tutorial will cover all the basic to advanced topics of C++ like C++ basics, C++ functions, C++ classes, OOPs and STL concepts.

## Key Features of C++

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

C++ supports the principles of OOP, enabling developers to create classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. This paradigm helps in organizing and structuring code for better maintainability and reusability.

### Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library in C++ provides a collection of classes and functions that implement various common data structures (like arrays, vectors, lists, maps) and algorithms (such as sorting, searching). This library simplifies complex tasks and enhances productivity.

### Performance and Efficiency

C++ allows fine-tuning of performance-critical parts of code by providing control over memory management and offering features like inline functions, which can significantly enhance execution speed.

### Portability

C++ code can be compiled on different platforms with minimal changes, making it a portable language suitable for cross-platform development.

## Getting Started

To start programming in C++, you'll need a development environment with a C++ compiler. Popular compilers include GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++. You can choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion to write and compile your code efficiently.

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Save this code in a file with a `.cpp` extension, compile it using a C++ compiler, and execute the resulting program to see the output.

## What's Next?

- **Learn Basic Syntax**: Dive into the syntax, data types, control structures, and functions in C++.
- **Explore Advanced Concepts**: Study topics like pointers, memory management, templates, and exception handling.
- **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Solve programming challenges and work on projects to reinforce your learning.
- **Refer Official Documentation**: Utilize online resources, books, and official C++ references to deepen your understanding.

C++ is a vast language with numerous possibilities. Enjoy your journey in mastering this versatile programming language!
