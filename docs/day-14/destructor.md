## Destructors in C++ - Introduction and Usage

A destructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It is used to release resources and clean up memory allocated by the object.

- ### **Purpose of Destructors:**
  - **Resource Deallocation:** Destructors release resources acquired by the object during its lifetime, such as memory, file handles, database connections, etc. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures efficient resource management.
  
  - **Cleanup Operations:** Destructors perform cleanup operations to ensure that the object is properly disposed of before its memory is reclaimed. This may include releasing dynamically allocated memory, closing open files, releasing locks, or any other necessary cleanup tasks.

- **Example:**
  ```cpp
  class Car {
  public:
      string brand;
      string model;
      int year;

      // Destructor
      ~Car() {
          // Cleanup code
      }
  };


### Advanced Usage:

 - **Custom Resource Management:** Destructors enable custom resource management techniques such as RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), where resource acquisition is tied to object lifetime. This pattern ensures that resources are automatically released when objects go out of scope, leading to more robust and exception-safe code.
  
  - **Handling Exceptions:** Destructors play a crucial role in exception handling. If an exception occurs during object construction, the destructor is automatically invoked to clean up any resources allocated before the exception was thrown. This helps maintain program integrity by ensuring that resources are properly released, even in the presence of exceptions.
  
  - **Finalization and Cleanup:** Destructors are used for finalization and cleanup tasks beyond simple resource deallocation. This includes tasks like logging finalization messages, updating persistent storage, or performing additional cleanup operations specific to the object's role within the application.
  
  - **Scoped Resource Management:** Destructors enable scoped resource management, where resources are acquired and released within a well-defined scope. This ensures that resources are released as soon as they are no longer needed, minimizing resource contention and improving overall system efficiency.
