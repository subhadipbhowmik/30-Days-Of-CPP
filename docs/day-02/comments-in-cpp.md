## 1. What is Comment in C++?
- A comment in C++ is a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the source code of a program.
- Comments are ignored by the compiler and are meant for the programmerâ€™s use only.
- They serve as a form of in-code documentation, helping developers understand the purpose, logic, or explanation behind specific code lines

## 2. Why do we use comments in C++?
Comments serve several purposes:
- Explanation: They explain the code, making it more readable and understandable for other programmers.
- Debugging: Comments can be useful for debugging by providing context or temporarily disabling code segments.
- Documentation: They document algorithms, variable purposes, or clarify unclear code segments.
- Collaboration: Comments help other developers understand your code when collaborating on projects.
- Code Readability: Comments significantly improve code readability, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand the logic and purpose of your code.
- Maintenance: Well-commented code is easier to maintain and update, as it provides context and explanations that can prevent misunderstandings or errors during modifications.

## 3. Write a simple program to demonstrate the use of comments in C++.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // This is a single-line comment
    cout << "Hello, World!"; // Another single-line comment
    return 0;
}
```
In this program, we use both single-line comments (//) to explain the code and prevent execution of those comment lines

## 4. Best Practices for Writing Comments
- Be Clear and Concise: While commenting in C++, make sure to stick to the point and comment clearly regarding the essential points only.
- Use Proper Grammar and Spelling: Proper grammar and spelling are very important and they make the comments more professional and easier to read.
- Avoid Redundant Comments: Don't comment about the obvious points. Comments should provide additional insight and not repeat what the code is already saying.
- Keep Comments Updated: As the code is modified, make sure to update or remove outdated comments to prevent confusion. Old comments that no longer match the code can mislead developers and cause bugs. So, always make sure to update comments when changing code.
- Avoid over-Commenting or under-Commenting: Too many comments can clutter your code and make it harder to read. On the other hand, failing to comment on complex logic or non-obvious code can again lead to confusion and errors. Thus, try to make a good balance.

## 5. Types of comments in C++
 i. Single Line Comment
- Starts with // and applies to a single line only.
- Compiler ignores any text after //.
- Used for brief explanations or annotations within a line of code.
Example:
``` cpp
int age = 25; // Stores the user's age

```
   ii. Multi Line Comment
- Starts with /* and ends with */.
- Can span multiple lines but cannot be nested.
- Any text between /* and */ is ignored by the compiler.
- Used for longer descriptions, explaining complex logic or function purposes.
Example:
```cpp
/*
* This function calculates the area of a rectangle
* given its length and width.
*/
int calculateArea(int length, int width) {
  // ... function implementation
}

 ```
   iii. Documentation Comment
- Used for documenting functions, classes, and their parameters.
- Typically starts with /** and ends with */.
- Contains additional information for tools like Doxygen.
- Example (not standard C++):
```cpp
/**
 * @param x integer value to add
 * @param y integer value to add
	@@ -66,3 +75,4 @@ int add(int x, int y) {
}
```

By effectively using comments, you can improve the understandability and maintainability of your C++ programs, both for yourself and others who may read your code in the future.
