## Memory Leaks and How to Avoid Them

Memory leaks occur when dynamically allocated memory is not deallocated, leading to wasted memory resources. They can cause programs to consume more memory over time, potentially leading to system crashes or slowdowns.

- **Identifying Memory Leaks:**
  - Use memory profiling tools like Valgrind, Dr. Memory, or built-in tools in IDEs to detect leaks.
  - Regularly review code to ensure every `new` has a corresponding `delete`.

- **Avoiding Memory Leaks:**
  - **Always Pair `new` with `delete`:**
    - Ensure that every allocation using `new` or `new[]` is paired with a corresponding `delete` or `delete[]`.
  - **Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):**
    - Tie resource management to object lifetimes. For example, use stack-allocated objects whose destructors handle resource cleanup.
    - Example:
      ```cpp
      class Resource {
      public:
          Resource() { data = new int[100]; }
          ~Resource() { delete[] data; }
      private:
          int* data;
      };
      ```
  - **Utilize Smart Pointers:**
    - Prefer using smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) which automatically manage memory.
    - Example:
      ```cpp
      std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(10)); // Memory automatically managed
      ```

By understanding and properly using these tools and techniques, you can effectively manage memory in your C++ programs, avoid common pitfalls, and ensure efficient use of resources.
