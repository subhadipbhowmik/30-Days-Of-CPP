Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects. Here are the key concepts of OOP:

1. **Objects**: Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single entity.

2. **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that all objects of the class will have.

3. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It allows data hiding and access control to protect the internal state of objects.

4. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.

5. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or their actual class. It allows methods to be defined in multiple forms (method overloading and method overriding).

These concepts collectively provide a structured approach to software design, promoting modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance of code. OOP is widely used across various programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and others, due to its advantages in managing complexity and improving code organization.
