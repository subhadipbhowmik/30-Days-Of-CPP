## while Loop

A `while` loop in C++ repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop's body.

### Example 1: Display Numbers from 1 to 5

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## do...while Loop

A `do...while` loop in C++ is similar to a `while` loop, except that the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop's body. This guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once.
