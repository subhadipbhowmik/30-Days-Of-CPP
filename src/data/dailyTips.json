    "Tip: Use 'const' whenever possible to avoid accidental changes.",
    "Tip: Prefer using 'auto' for type inference to make code cleaner.",
    "Tip: Don’t confuse assign (=) with test-for-equality (==).",
    "Tip: Remember: semi’s after class declarations, not functions.",
    "Tip: Break problems down: When faced with a complex problem, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Solve each part individually before combining them into a solution.",
    "Tip: Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) to manage resources and avoid memory leaks.",
    "Tip: Practice using the Standard Template Library (STL) to simplify common tasks.",
    "Tip: Learn and understand the differences between pointers and references.",
    "Tip: Always initialize variables to avoid undefined behavior.",
    "Tip: Use smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) to manage dynamic memory safely.",
    "Tip: Avoid using raw pointers unless absolutely necessary.",
